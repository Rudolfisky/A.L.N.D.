# Shooting Mechanism LOFI


# What
We want to figure out a functional LoFi prototype to show people a main function of ALND.

# Why
We feel that showing people a simple manual shooting/launching mechanism will better convey our concept.

# How
Using rapid prototyping (and a laser cuter <3) we will produce prototypes in order to learn how to successfully propel an object.

# Result
![SM LF MK1](../Media/prototype%20images/SM%20LF%20MK1.jpg)<br/>
The MK1 was a very simple "top of the head" idea. After making a physical version I realized a couple of important things.<br/>
1. The rubber band doesn't fit.
2. this can be solved.


We can solve this if we made the base broader and shortened the prototype<br/>

So we did.<br/>
