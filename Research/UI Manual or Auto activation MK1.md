# UI Manual or Auto activation


# What
With this prototype, we are going to test whether users prefer an manual activation system or a automatic system to activate the ALND.

# Why
We want to know whether a user wants to have a manual or automated ALND activation mechanic in order to better focus on the user experience.

# How
In order to test this out, we are going to test 2 different mechanics to see which ones performs best. The testing will be done using the [A/B-Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing).

## Methods
### Manual: Button
The manual system will be represented by a button. When the button is pressed we will proceed imitate the ALND purpose by throwing a nut at the tester.

### Automatic: open mouth detection
The automatic system will be represented by activation on facial movement. When the user opens their mouth, we will proceed to imitate the activation of the ALND, which does include some more nut throwing.

# Result
Out of seven people queried, 100% indicated they would prefer the button press. When queried about their reasoning, people indicated they mainly feared the mouth opening activation would trigger accidentally, for example when talking or yawning. Many did like the idea of an automatic cocktail nut dispenser - even as a joke - but felt the trigger would need to be more robust. Some did suggest other options for triggers, like opening your mouth for a few seconds, or combining it with a specific gesture.

# Conclusion
While this is definitely interesting data, our project occupies a more unique space - we’re not trying to make the best possible product to launch cocktail nuts into people’s mouth, but instead want to make a point about technology being used to solve increasingly more mundane problems, supporting laziness instead of truly bettering lives. While pressing a button isn’t exactly a physically intensive action, it doesn’t quite conjure the same image of sloth as only having to open your mouth, which is why we decided to move ahead with the mouth opening activation in spite of the gathered data.
