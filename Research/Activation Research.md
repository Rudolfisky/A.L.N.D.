# Activation Research

When we started the project, we had some discussion about how a user would actually trigger the ALND, so we decided to perform some research to find out what their preference would be.

We wanted to test two different ways of activation: pressing a button, or simply opening your mouth.

We set up a very low fidelity test; because we didn’t have a functioning launching mechanism yet, we couldn’t use that to fire the cocktail nuts. Instead, we simply threw them ourselves whenever the relevant trigger was activated. To simulate a button we created a fake version out of paper that people could ‘press’ whenever they wanted a cocktail nut. Subjects were divided into two groups, one for the button and one for the mouth opening.

Out of seven people queried, 100% indicated they would prefer the button press. When queried about their reasoning, people indicated they mainly feared the mouth opening activation would trigger accidentally, for example when talking or yawning. Many did like the idea of an automatic cocktail nut dispenser - even as a joke - but felt the trigger would need to be more robust. Some did suggest other options for triggers, like opening your mouth for a few seconds, or combining it with a specific gesture.

While this is definitely interesting data, our project occupies a more unique space - we’re not trying to make the best possible product to launch cocktail nuts into people’s mouth, but instead want to make a point about technology being used to solve increasingly more mundane problems, supporting laziness instead of truly bettering lives. While pressing a button isn’t exactly a physically intensive action, it doesn’t quite conjure the same image of sloth as only having to open your mouth, which is why we decided to move ahead with the mouth opening activation in spite of the gathered data.
