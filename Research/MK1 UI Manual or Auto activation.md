# UI Manual or Auto activation


# What
With this prototype, we are going to test whether users prefer an manual activation system or a automatic system to activate the ALND.

# Why
We want to know whether a user wants to have a manual or automated ALND activation mechanic in order to better focus on the user experience

# How
In order to test this out, we are going to test 2 different mechanics to see which ones performs best. The testing will be done using the [A/B-Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing).

## Methods
### Manual: Button
The manual system will be represented by a button. When the button is pressed we will proceed imitate the ALND purpose by throwing a nut at the tester.

### Automatic: open mouth detection
The automatic system will be represented by activation on facial movement. When the user opens their mouth, we will proceed to imitate the activation of the ALND, which does include some more nut throwing.
