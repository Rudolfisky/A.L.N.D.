# A.L.N.D. 
Automatic Long distance Nut Dispenser (ALND)

# Vision
Humans are lazy by design, so we decided to feed our sinfull desires by automating and 'simplifying' the process of eating nuts, borrelnootjes to be precise.

# Concept
We are making a machine that can automatically. 
shoot nuts over a distance into the users mouth. 
We plan to make a a canon shaped deviuce fited with an autmatic nut feeding system. 
The ALND will be able to detect a face, detect an open mouth, meausure the distance, and shoot a singular nut right on target.

# Duo project components 
Considering we only have 5 weeks (when writing this document) we are unlikely going to create a face tracking nut canon. 
but no fear, we will work on the most crucial components, such as:
- A barel capable of holding nuts and nut loading capability.
- A spring mechanism capable of launching nuts out of the barel.
- A detection mechanism for detecting a face.
- A mechanism for automatically loading nuts into the barel.
- A aiming mechanism for aiming the barel.


## Lo-Fi
the Lo-Fi fase will include some testing  regarding user interaction. 
We need to figure out whether a button for firing the nuts or open mouth detection is better.

## Mid-Fi

## Hi-Fi

# Planning

## Week 1 Idea week
This week we spend creating our magnificent idea.
We also had a bunch of workshops relating to getting ideas, and working with technology.

## Week 2 
This week we spent perfecting the idea and working on a planning.
Again, this week was filled with concepting workshops.
## Week 3 Interaction testing
This week we'll spend on getting UI data using a Lo-Fi prototype, we will try to test the following:
- Button activation or open mouth activation.
- more test cases to come
We'd also need to define what the prototype means to test and what we need
also, we are going to work POC for barel mechanism.
## Week 4
- POC for nut launching mechanism.
- POC for launch activation (facial or button).
- Combine POC's into Mid-Fi prototype

## Week 5
- POC for aiming.
- POC for loading.
- Combine POC's into Mid-Fi prototype
## Week 6
- Work on Hi-Fi
- final demo
