# A.L.N.D. 
Automatic Long distance Nut Dispenser (ALND)

# Vision
Humans are lazy by design, so we decided to feed our sinfull desires by automating and 'simplifying' the process of eating nuts, borrelnootjes to be precise.

# Concept
We are making a machine that can automatically. 
shoot nuts over a distance into the users mouth. 
We plan to make a a canon shaped deviuce fited with an autmatic nut feeding system. 
The ALND will be able to detect a face, detect an open mouth, meausure the distance, and shoot a singular nut right on target.

# duo project components 
Considering we only have 5 weeks (when writing this document) we are unlikely going to create a face tracking nut canon. 
but no fear, we will work on the most crucial components, such as:
- A barel capable of holding nuts and nut loading capability.
- A spring mechanism capable of launcing nuts out of the barel.
- A detection mechanism for detecting a face.
- A mechanism for automatically loading nuts into the barel.
- A aiming mechanism for aiming the barel.


## Lo-Fi
the Lo-Fi fase will include some testing  regarding user interaction. 
We need to figure out whether a button for firing the nuts or open mouth detection is better.
